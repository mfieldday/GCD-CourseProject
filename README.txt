An example of Tidy Data preparation in R

The accompanying file “PhoneMovementMeasures.txt” contains a tidy data set derived from a course called “Getting and Cleaning Data” taught by Jeff Leek from the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and delivered online via Coursera. The data come originally from Davide Anguita et al. (2012).

The data were collected in an experiment in which 30 people performed six different activities (i.e. walking, walking up stairs, walking down stairs, sitting, standing, lying down) while wearing Samsung phones that contained an accelerometer and gyroscope. The data recorded by the phones’ sensors during these distinct activities were processed to yield measures of acceleration and velocity in three-dimensional space.

More information about data collection, data processing and derivation of the variables can be found in the README file provided by the original researchers (appended below in its original form). More information about the variables contained in the file “PhoneMovementMeasures.txt” can be found in the file “Codebook.md”

My work consisted of cleaning and amalgamating some of the files that were downloaded from the web. The R code for the entire process is contained in the file “run_analyis.R”. Running this code will reproduce the file “PhoneMovementMeasures.txt”. Briefly, the process entails downloading the original data set, loading and joining some of the files, removing some of the variables, modifying the original variable names and calculating the mean of each variable for each combination of activity and subject.

==================================================================

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 

For each record it is provided:
======================================

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

The dataset includes the following files:
=========================================

- 'README.txt'

- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

- 'features.txt': List of all features.

- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent. 

- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second. 

Notes: 
======
- Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
- Each feature vector is a row on the text file.
